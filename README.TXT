Description
===========
SemNaaS is a Semantic Web based approach for developing and supporting operations of NaaS systems. SemNaaS can be used by any NaaS provider but we have tested it with with the existing OpenNaaS framework. Furthermore, SemNaaS exposes its functionality as set of APIs and RESTful web services, which OpenNaaS consumes.

SemNaaS aims to improve OpenNaaS using Semantic Web technologies. It has several potential improvement aspects on OpenNaaS:
	- Support of network request validation and network connectivity check;
	- System monitoring and failure condition detection;
	- Capability of constructing distributed and interconnected OpenNaaS instances;
	- Complex status report generation.
